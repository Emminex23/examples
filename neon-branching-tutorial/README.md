# True "Branch-Based Environments": Combining Signadot Sandboxes with Neon DB Branching

Ephemeral sandbox environments solve many problems for microservices teams. You can spin up an isolated copy of your service, test your changes, and tear it down. No conflicts with other developers. No waiting for a shared staging slot.

But here's the catch: your sandbox service still connects to the same staging database as everyone else. One developer's test writes pollute another's queries. Schema migrations break active tests. Seed data disappears mid-run. The application layer is isolated, but the data layer is not.

This guide shows you how to fix that problem. You will combine Signadot Sandboxes with Neon's database branching to create true full-stack isolation. Every sandbox gets its own application fork and its own database branch. When the sandbox dies, the database branch dies with it.

## What You Will Build

The end-to-end system works as follows:

1. A developer creates a Signadot Sandbox
2. A Resource Plugin automatically creates a Neon database branch and exposes the connection string as an output
3. The sandbox pod starts with a connection string pointing to the isolated branch
4. The developer runs tests against isolated data
5. The developer deletes the sandbox
6. The Resource Plugin deletes the Neon branch automatically

No shared state. No test pollution. No manual cleanup scripts.

## How It Works

The architecture relies on two key technologies working together.

**Neon Database Branching**: Neon uses copy-on-write storage to create instant database branches. A branch inherits all schema and data from its parent but operates independently. Writes to a branch don't affect the parent, and branches can be created or deleted in seconds with minimal storage overhead.

**Signadot Resource Plugins**: Resource Plugins extend Signadot's sandbox lifecycle with custom provisioning logic. When a sandbox starts, the plugin runs a create workflow. When the sandbox terminates, the plugin runs a delete workflow. Outputs from the create workflow (like connection strings) can be injected directly into sandbox pods.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- `kubectl` and `minikube` installed
- A [Neon account](https://neon.tech) with an API key
- The `neonctl` CLI installed and authenticated
- A [Signadot account](https://www.signadot.com/) with the operator installed in your cluster
- The `signadot` CLI installed and authenticated

## Baseline Environment

We'll set up a users microservice connected to a Neon database, then demonstrate how sandboxes can get isolated database branches.

### Step 1: Clone the Example Repository

The example repository contains a pre-built users microservice and all necessary Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/git/signadot/
cd ~/git/signadot/
git clone https://github.com/signadot/examples.git
cd examples/neon-branching-tutorial
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Neon Database

Create a Neon project:

```bash
neonctl projects create --name users-demo
```
![Create a Neon project](./images/img-001.png)

Note the project ID from the output (e.g., `sparkling-queen-66410086`). You'll need it throughout this tutorial.

Retrieve the connection string and create the schema:

```bash
neonctl connection-string main \
  --project-id <your-project-id> \
  --database-name neondb
```

Connect to the database and run the schema file:

```bash
psql "<connection-string>" -f schema.sql
```

The `schema.sql` file creates a `users` table and inserts three seed records. Every sandbox branch will inherit this data.

Generate an API key for the Resource Plugin:

1. Go to the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/)
2. Navigate to **Account Settings > Personal API keys**
3. Click **Create new API key** and save it securely

### Step 3: Deploy to Minikube

Start minikube and build the demo image:

```bash
minikube start

eval $(minikube docker-env)
make build
```

Create the required secrets:

```bash
make setup-db-secret      # Enter your Neon connection string when prompted
make setup-neon-secret    # Enter your Neon API key when prompted
```

Deploy the baseline service:

```bash
make deploy
```

Verify the deployment:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=users-service
```
![Verify the deployment](./images/img-002.png)

You should see pods in `Running` state with `2/2` containers (the service plus the Signadot routing sidecar).

### Step 4: Install the Resource Plugin

The Resource Plugin bridges Signadot and Neon. Take a look at `neon-branch-plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
name: neon-branch
spec:
  description: Creates and deletes Neon database branches for sandbox isolation
  
  runner:
    image: node:20-alpine
    namespace: signadot
    podTemplateOverlay: |
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: main
            env:
              - name: NEON_API_KEY
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: neon-api-credentials
                    key: NEON_API_KEY

  create:
    - name: createbranch
      inputs:
        - name: project-id
          valueFromSandbox: true
          as:
            env: NEON_PROJECT_ID
        - name: parent-branch
          valueFromSandbox: true
          as:
            env: PARENT_BRANCH
        - name: database-name
          valueFromSandbox: true
          as:
            env: DATABASE_NAME
      script: |
        #!/bin/sh
        set -e
        npm install -g neonctl

        SAFE_NAME=$(echo "${SIGNADOT_SANDBOX_NAME}" | tr -d '-')
        BRANCH_NAME="sandbox${SAFE_NAME}"

        neonctl branches create \
          --project-id "${NEON_PROJECT_ID}" \
          --name "${BRANCH_NAME}" \
          --parent "${PARENT_BRANCH}" \
          --output json > /tmp/branch-output.json

        BRANCH_ID=$(cat /tmp/branch-output.json | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

        CONNECTION_STRING=$(neonctl connection-string "${BRANCH_NAME}" \
          --project-id "${NEON_PROJECT_ID}" \
          --database-name "${DATABASE_NAME}")

        mkdir -p /outputs
        echo -n "${BRANCH_NAME}" > /outputs/branch-name
        echo -n "${BRANCH_ID}" > /outputs/branch-id
        echo -n "${CONNECTION_STRING}" > /outputs/connection-string

      outputs:
        - name: branch-name
          valueFromPath: /outputs/branch-name
        - name: branch-id
          valueFromPath: /outputs/branch-id
        - name: connection-string
          valueFromPath: /outputs/connection-string

  delete:
    - name: deletebranch
      inputs:
        - name: project-id
          valueFromSandbox: true
          as:
            env: NEON_PROJECT_ID
        - name: branch-name
          valueFromStep:
            name: createbranch
            output: branch-name
          as:
            env: BRANCH_NAME
      script: |
        #!/bin/sh
        set -e
        npm install -g neonctl
        neonctl branches delete "${BRANCH_NAME}" --project-id "${NEON_PROJECT_ID}"
```

The plugin has three main sections:

- **runner**: Uses `node:20-alpine` with the Neon API key injected via `podTemplateOverlay`. The runner executes in the `signadot` namespace where the API key secret exists.
- **create**: Installs `neonctl`, creates a branch named after the sandbox, retrieves the connection string, and exposes it as an output. The script sanitizes the sandbox name by removing hyphens since Neon branch names work best with alphanumeric characters.
- **delete**: Reads the branch name from the create step's output (using `valueFromStep`) and deletes it.

Apply the plugin:

```bash
signadot resourceplugin apply -f neon-branch-plugin.yaml
```

### Step 5: Configure the Sandbox Specification

The sandbox spec ties everything together. Review `users-sandbox.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "@{sandbox-name}"
spec:
  description: "Users service sandbox with isolated Neon database branch"
  cluster: "@{cluster}"

  resources:
    - name: usersDb
      plugin: neon-branch
      params:
        project-id: "@{neon-project-id}"
        parent-branch: "main"
        database-name: "neondb"

  forks:
    - forkOf:
        kind: Deployment
        namespace: default
        name: users-service
      customizations:
        env:
          - name: DATABASE_URL
            valueFrom:
              resource:
                name: usersDb
                outputKey: createbranch.connection-string

  defaultRouteGroup:
    endpoints:
      - name: users-api
        target: http://users-service.default.svc:3000
```

The key sections:

- **resources**: Invokes the `neon-branch` plugin with project parameters passed at apply time.
- **forks**: Creates a copy of the `users-service` Deployment with the `DATABASE_URL` overridden. The `valueFrom.resource` field references the plugin output directly using the format `<step-name>.<output-name>`. No intermediate Kubernetes Secret is required.
- **defaultRouteGroup**: Creates a preview URL for accessing the sandboxed service.

## Using Sandboxes

Create a sandbox with an isolated database branch:

```bash
signadot sandbox apply -f users-sandbox.yaml \
  --set sandbox-name=my-feature \
  --set cluster=<your-cluster-name> \
  --set neon-project-id=<your-project-id>
```

### Verify Branch Creation

Check the Neon branches:

```bash
neonctl branches list --project-id <your-project-id>
```

![Check the Neon branches](./images/img-003.png)

You should see both `main` and `sandboxmyfeature` branches.

### Test Data Isolation

Query the sandbox endpoint to see the inherited seed data:

```bash
curl -H "signadot-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
  "https://users-api--my-feature.preview.signadot.com/users"
```

![Query the sandbox](./images/img-004.png)

Create a test user in the sandbox:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "signadot-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Sandbox User", "email": "sandbox@test.example"}' \
  "https://users-api--my-feature.preview.signadot.com/users"
```

![Create a test user](./images/img-005.png)

Verify the main branch remains unaffected:

```bash
neonctl connection-string main --project-id <your-project-id> --database-name neondb
psql "<connection-string>" -c "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'sandbox@test.example';"
```

![Verify the main branch](./images/img-006.png)

The query returns zero rows. The sandbox user exists only in the branch.

### Cleanup

Delete the sandbox:

```bash
signadot sandbox delete my-feature
```

The Resource Plugin's delete workflow automatically removes the Neon branch:

```bash
neonctl branches list --project-id <your-project-id>
```

![Verify cleanup](./images/img-007.png)

Only the `main` branch remains.

## Conclusion

Each Signadot Sandbox now gets its own forked microservice pods and its own isolated Neon database branch. The Resource Plugin handles the entire lifecycle: creating branches on sandbox creation, exposing connection strings through built-in outputs, and cleaning them up on deletion. Test data cannot leak between sandboxes, and schema migrations in one branch cannot break tests in another.

The cost efficiency makes this practical for everyday use. Neon branches use copy-on-write storage, so you only pay for data that changes. Signadot sandboxes share baseline cluster resources. Branch creation and teardown complete in seconds. Every developer gets an isolated app and database for every pull request.
